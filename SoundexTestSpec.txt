Test Cases
1. HandlesBasicCases
Objective: Ensure that the function handles basic cases, including empty strings, single characters, and correct padding with zeros.

Test Case 1.1: Handles Empty String

Input: ""
Expected Output: ""
Description: Verify that an empty string returns an empty Soundex code.
Test Case 1.2: Handles Single Character

Input: "A"

Expected Output: "A000"

Description: Verify that a single character is returned followed by three zeros.

Input: "Z"

Expected Output: "Z000"

Description: Verify that a single character other than 'A' is returned followed by three zeros.

Test Case 1.3: Handles Padding with Zeros

Input: "Bob"
Expected Output: "B100"
Description: Verify that the Soundex code is padded with zeros when necessary.
2. HandlesSimpleNames
Objective: Verify that the function generates correct Soundex codes for simple, multi-character names with distinct Soundex codes.

Test Case 2.1: Simple Name Example 1

Input: "Sam"
Expected Output: "S500"
Description: Verify the Soundex code for the name "Sam".
Test Case 2.2: Simple Name Example 2

Input: "Rubin"
Expected Output: "R150"
Description: Verify the Soundex code for the name "Rubin".
Test Case 2.3: Different Letters Example

Input: "Pfister"
Expected Output: "P236"
Description: Verify the Soundex code for the name "Pfister".
3. HandlesConsecutiveLettersWithSameCode
Objective: Ensure that consecutive letters with the same Soundex code are handled correctly, showing the reduction of consecutive duplicates.

Test Case 3.1: Name with Consecutive Letters Example 1

Input: "Bobby"
Expected Output: "B100"
Description: Verify that consecutive letters with the same Soundex code are reduced to a single occurrence.
Test Case 3.2: Name with Consecutive Letters Example 2

Input: "Jackson"
Expected Output: "J250"
Description: Verify that consecutive letters with the same Soundex code are handled correctly.
4. HandlesPaddingWithZeros
Objective: Ensure that the Soundex code is always padded to a length of exactly four characters.

Test Case 4.1: Single Character Input Example 1

Input: "A"
Expected Output: "A000"
Description: Verify that single characters are padded correctly.
Test Case 4.2: Single Character Input Example 2

Input: "B"
Expected Output: "B000"
Description: Verify that single characters are padded with zeros.
5. HandlesDifferentLettersWithSameCode
Objective: Verify that different letters which map to the same Soundex code are correctly encoded in the output.

Test Case 5.1: Name with Different Letters Example
Input: "Tymczak"
Expected Output: "T522"
Description: Verify the Soundex code for the name "Tymczak".
